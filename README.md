# Stroke-prediction-using-R

## Abstract

Stroke prediction is a critical aspect of modern healthcare, enabling early intervention and prevention strategies to reduce the incidence and severity of stroke-related complications. In this project, we leverage a dataset containing 11 clinical features to develop a predictive model for stroke events. Our objective is to build a robust and well-validated model that healthcare providers can use to identify individuals at high risk of stroke and implement timely interventions.

Through extensive data exploration, cleaning, processing, and analysis, we identify key patient characteristics and clinical factors associated with stroke risk. Using machine learning techniques, specifically classification algorithms, we train and validate our predictive model on the prepared dataset. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC).
