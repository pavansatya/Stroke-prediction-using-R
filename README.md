# Stroke-prediction-using-R

## Abstract

Stroke prediction is a critical aspect of modern healthcare, enabling early intervention and prevention strategies to reduce the incidence and severity of stroke-related complications. In this project, we leverage a dataset containing 11 clinical features to develop a predictive model for stroke events. Our objective is to build a robust and well-validated model that healthcare providers can use to identify individuals at high risk of stroke and implement timely interventions.

Through extensive data exploration, cleaning, processing, and analysis, we identify key patient characteristics and clinical factors associated with stroke risk. Using machine learning techniques, specifically classification algorithms, we train and validate our predictive model on the prepared dataset. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC).

## Data Collection

The dataset used in this project was sourced from the Coursera project database, a reputable repository known for providing high-quality datasets for educational and research purposes.

The dataset consists of 11 clinical features, each offering valuable insights into different aspects of patient health and medical history. These features include demographic information, medical conditions, and lifestyle factors.

Out of the 11 clinical features, 10 were deemed relevant for the predictive modeling task based on their potential significance in predicting stroke events. The selection process involved careful consideration of each feature's contribution to the predictive accuracy of the model.
